    "## Images from week 08\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall previous week's main takeaways about Python module PIL and working with images, you'll remember that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Module `pillow`, referred to as `PIL` allows us to create and manipulate images\n",
    "* Colors are created using RGB spectrum of channels, with each color (Red, Green and Blue) representing a separate channel\n",
    "* Each channel (R, G, and B) is expressed using an integer between 0 and 255\n",
    "* A pixel's RGB setting tells it precisely what shade of color it should display\n",
    "* Image pixels are addressed with x- and y-coordinates, which respectively specify a pixel's horizontal and vertical locations in an image\n",
    "* The origin is the pixel at the top-left corner of the image at the (x,y) value of (0, 0)\n",
    "* x-values increase horizontally to the right, while y-values increase vertically down from (0, 0) point\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manipulating images\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you are going to extend your previous experience of working with images. If you need to edit a large number of images, editing them by hand using Microsoft Paint, Gimp, or Adobe Photoshop can be a lengthy and painful task. Python can come to the rescue in this scenario. Pillow module in Python contains several functions that make it easy to crop, resize, and edit images. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you remember from week 08, an image consist of pixels, each having an RGB value. Pillow offers the `ImageColor.getcolor()` function so you can get RGB values for the colors you want to use. This function takes a color name string as its first argument, and the string `RGB` as its second argument, and it returns a tuple. You will need to import `ImageColor` part of `PIL` to use this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import ImageColor\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageColor.getcolor('red', 'RGB')\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageColor.getcolor('chocolate', 'RGB')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow supports a large variety of colors, from \"aliceblue\" to \"whitesmoke\". Pillow uses the standard color names that HTML uses - [Web Colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `import` the module's `ImageColor` piece and get RGB value for a color other than red and chocolate."

After making an `Image` object from `g_wiz.png` and storing the `Image` object in `gwiz` variable, we can see that the object's size attribute contains a tuple of the image's width and height in pixels when we use the function called `size`. \n",

    "### Cropping Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Cropping an image means selecting a rectangular region inside an image and removing everything outside the rectangle. The `crop` method on `Image` objects takes a box tuple and returns an `Image` object representing the cropped image. Cropping does not alter the original `Image` object, instead the `crop` method returns a new `Image` object. Specifically, it returns a rectangular region with a 4-tuple defining the left, upper, right, and lower pixel coordinate of the cropped rectangular region. For example, assuming you imported `Image` and opened `g_wiz.png` image and saved it into `gwiz` variable, and using width and height variables from step 2., you can crop the right half of the image and save it as a new \"cropped.png\" image as follows.\n",
