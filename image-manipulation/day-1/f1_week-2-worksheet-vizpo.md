# Worksheet 2.1.0: "Drawing" text

Today, our goal is to recreate the following "visual poem" -- a work which derives as much (if not more) meaning from its spatial arrangement as it does its text. Here, we have a text by concrete poet Eugen Gomringer; later on in this worksheet, you'll work to reproduce another, smaller work on your own.

The main features of our task:

* incorporate type into our pictures
* automatically align content
* (optional) introduce color to the typeface for all words, word-by-word, or even letter by letter

To do so, we'll:

* load a text from a file
* load a typeface from a file
* calculate how much space the text/type combination takes up
* center the poem itself
* add an attribution in the lower right corner

We'll complete our work together using the [f1_week-2-worksheet-vizpo.py](f1_week-2-worksheet-vizpo.py) file. Once we've done that, you have a few options:

* continue working on the assignment we started yesterday (the art)
* work on exploring more methods and image properties in [0_week-2-worksheet-files.ipynb](0_week-2-worksheet-files.ipynb)
* complete the additional poem in [f1_week-2-worksheet-vizpo-2.py](f1_week-2-worksheet-vizpo-2.py)
  * The poem and poet for this poem: "lighght" by Aram Saroyan
  * This poem made a lot of people mad at the NEA when it first appeared
    * Like, legit mad
