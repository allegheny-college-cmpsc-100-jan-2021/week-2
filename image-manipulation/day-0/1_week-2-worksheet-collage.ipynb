    "We often come upon some requirement for functionality which necessitates creating a function. Perhaps we want to organize our code. Maybe we're looking at doing something many, many times and only want to write the procedure for a _very specific_ operation once. In any event, functions will become part of our regular vocabulary from here to the end of this course (and likely your entire career in Python).\n",
